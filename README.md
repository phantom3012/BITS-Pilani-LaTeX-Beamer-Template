The intention of this repository is to document the presentation template used for PS2 presentations: both midsem and final presentation. 

To get an idea of what the final presentation would look like, check out the `pdf` files present on the other branches of this repo. The presentations will be present under the `bits_pilani_beamer` folder. 

If you want to create a presentation of your own, download the zip file of this repo and follow the next steps (it is assumed you know either have basic LaTeX knowledge or you know how beamer presentations work):

- Go to the specific folder (pilani/dubai/hyderabad/WILP) (each beamer template in these folders have a different cover page corresponding to that campus)
- Edit the file: `BITS_<campus>_beamer_template.tex` to create your presentations
- Update all the figures under the `figures` folder for easy access
- Your final presentation will be compiled to a `*pdf` file.

If you don't know how to compile LaTeX files, you can upload the zip file you've downloaded to overleaf and make the edits over there.
